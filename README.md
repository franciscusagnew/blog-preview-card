## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) -  Collaborative design tool for building meaningful products.

### Key Takeaways

In this code challenge, I aimed to build a blog preview card that matches the provided design as closely as possible. Through this project, I've gained more knowledge and experience:

Creating semantic HTML components: I structured my component in a way that accurately represents the design and content.

Designing with attention to detail: I practiced getting my solution to look similar to the requirements of the design, paying close attention to visual styling and layout.

Responsive design techniques: I reduced the font size of the design for smaller screens without using media queries, achieving a better mobile experience.

### Continued development

I love honing my skills & constantly learning new techniques, resources, & practices to inhance my knowledge of web & software development.

I have found that having a greater understanding, appreciation, & talent towards working on projects that involves a UX, UI design process before approaching the development process is a more effective, efficient, productive, & rewarding experience for all developers to adopt.

It allows developers to empathize, view, & work on the whole process alongside designers with a broader & more humbling approach & perspective. So, I highly recommend developers learn [UX](https://www.nngroup.com/) & [UI](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ui-design) concepts, tools, & practices along with getting skilled at using & intergrating [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
